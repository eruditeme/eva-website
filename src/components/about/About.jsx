            Hey, I'm Evangeline, a fourth year UofT student doing a double major in Computer Science and 
            Geographical Information Systems, as well as a minor in Economics.
          </p>

            <p>Here are a few technologies that I have been working with:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Python</li>
              <li>PostgreSQL</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>
              <li>HTML, CSS</li>
              <li>React</li>
              <li>Django</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p className='bios'>
            Outside of work and academics, I enjoy creating digital art, listening to music,
            and playing video games. My favorite video games of all time would be Persona 5 ‚òï and Stardew Valley üåª,
            but you can probably catch me playing Tetris üïπÔ∏èüß± most of the time.
